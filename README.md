![alt text](https://github.com/supermariofps/hatsune-miku-linux-cursors/blob/main/thumb.png?raw=true)

This cursor set is a modified version of a small Windows set created by [petit devil (ぷちでびる)](https://petitcan.blog.shinobi.jp) with a few original ones made by myself!
Thanks a lot to [@AshtakaOOf](https://github.com/AshtakaOOf) for [locating the original artist](https://github.com/supermariofps/hatsune-miku-windows-linux-cursors/issues/16)!

Hope you like it!
